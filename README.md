# Infix to Postfix and Expression Evaluator
This project is for converting mathematical expression from infix to postfix as well as evaluating the expression.
Using a simple GUI interface to interact with the evaluator, its soul purpose is to make the interaction more appealing, instead of using the terminal.
You can evaluate any kind of expression(Not limited to a single digit)
